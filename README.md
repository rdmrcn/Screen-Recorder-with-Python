# Screen Recorder with Python

This Python script records your screen and saves it as a video file. It uses `pyautogui` for taking screenshots, `opencv` (cv2) for creating and saving the video, and `keyboard` to stop the recording by pressing the 'q' key.

## Features

- Screen recording at a specified frame rate (default: 24 fps).
- Saves the video as an `.mp4` file.
- Press 'q' to stop the recording at any time.
- Fully customizable for file paths and frame rate.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pyautogui`
- `opencv-python`
- `keyboard`
- `numpy`

You can install all dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pyautogui opencv-python keyboard numpy
